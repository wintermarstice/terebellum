# `terebellum`

Terebellum is an open-source virtual machine software. It aims to provide a lightweight and performant platform for running virtual machines on a variety of host operating systems.

While there are excellent virtual machine software options available, they come with their own set of trade-offs, such as performance, ease of use, native UIs, feature richness, or price. Terebellum aims to achieve the Pareto frontier of these areas, striving to provide the best possible in all five.

Despite all these ambitious goals, I also want to point out that Terebellum is a passion project started by BuÄŸra Kadirhan (that's me), mainly driven by personal use and learning purposes. It's not a commercial product, and I'm not affiliated with any company or organization. It's something I'm working on my own free time, and is a labor of love. Please don't forget this fact when interacting with the project.

# Roadmap

The roadmap for Terebellum is still in its early stages, but here are some of the key milestones I'm aiming to achieve:

### Native UI

Terebellum is intended to be designed to look, feel and behave just like every other (native) application on your system.

Part of this is using the native UI toolkit of your operating system. This means that Terebellum will use the native features like drag and drop, copy and paste, tabs, error messages and other features that you're familiar with. This will make it easier to use and more intuitive. This also includes standard keyboard and mouse shortcuts. Terebellum tries to match the conventions of your operating system as closely as possible.

Another part of this is to avoid using last-stand hacks like "we'll just use a web browser to render the UI". This is not only a performance killer, but also a usability nightmare.

### Competitive Performance

Terebellum strives to be performant. This means that it should be able to run virtual machines at a speed that is comparable to other virtual machine software. Speed is a key factor in usability, and Terebellum aims to provide a fast and responsive experience, **without compromising on security and integrity**.
